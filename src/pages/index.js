          My name is Viktors Telle, and I am a system architect and full-stack
          developer with 12+ years of experience. I have worked at a variety of
          companies ranging from small startups to enterprise companies.

          My focus is primarily on developing applications using .NET Core and
          SPA frameworks like React and Angular. I also have experience in
          creating up CI/CD pipelines in TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, and Azure
          DevOps. I also have experience in coaching and mentoring other
          developers for the last five years.
