        <p>Welcome to my site.</p>
        <p>
          My name is Viktors Telle, and I am a system architect and full-stack
          developer with 12+ years of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is primarily on developing applications using .NET Core and
          SPA frameworks like React and Angular. I am also experienced in
          setting up CI/CD pipelines in TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, and Azure
          DevOps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have coached and mentored other developers for the last 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also occasionally write about my personal experience with different
          technologies.
        </p>
