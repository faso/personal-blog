        <p>Welcome to my site.</p>
        <p>
          My name is Viktors Telle, and I am a system architect and full-stack
          developer with 12+ years of experience. I have worked at a variety of
          companies ranging from small startups to enterprise companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is primarily on developing applications using .NET Core and
          SPA frameworks like React and Angular. I have experience in creating
          up CI/CD pipelines in TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, and Azure DevOps. I
          have experience in coaching and mentoring other developers for the
          last five years.
        </p>
        <p>Occasionally I share my personal work experience in my blog.</p>
