I work from home for five months. I will lie if I say that it was easy. It definitely would have been easier if I did not have two small kids at home.
I am a system architect at a large enterprise company. Before Covid-19 started, I worked from home occasionally. Mostly to allow my wife to do the important things for her. I forgot to mention that we had only one child before the pandemic started. Most of the parents will probably agree with me that it is much easier to manage your day if you have only one child. Now we have two kids with a small age difference. And it is much harder now to organize your day so that everyone is happy.
