I work from home for five months. I will lie if I say that it was easy. It definitely would have been easier if I did not have two small kids at home. I am a system architect at a large enterprise company. Before Covid-19 started, I worked from home occasionally. Mostly to allow my wife to do the important things for her. We had only one child at that time. Most of the parents will probably agree with me that it is much easier to manage your day if you have only one child. Now we have two kids with a small age difference. And it is much harder now to organize your day so that everyone is happy. I will share my experience, daily routine, and tips on how to manage your day to be productive at work, stay healthy, and also spend time with your family.

## Decide On Your Working Hours

Find the most productive and acceptable time for work. For me, it is morning. I wake up at 6:00 and work until my daughter (oldest child) wakes up, which is usually around 7:00. Then I prepare the breakfast for us. I let my wife sleep until 8:00 since she has to wake up in the night to feed our son. Then I spent about 30 minutes with them, make a coffee, and switch back to work mode. I have a separate working room, and the doors are closed when I am working. If something important happens, then my wife can come and ask for my assistance.

## Spend Time With Your Kids

I disagree with the statement that the father should work, and the mother should take care of the children. Of course, the mother does most of the job, but the father should be a part of raising the children, especially when children are at a young age. It helps you to develop a strong relationship with your children. Dedicate at least a couple of hours a day to spent quality time with children without distractions. By distractions, I mean smartphones and other sorts of gadgets.

## Find The Activity To Keep You Fit And Healthy

I walk every day to stay fit. Get yourself a smartwatch or fitness tracker.

## How To Stay Focused

Try to eliminate all the unnecessary distractions like social networks. You would be surprised how much time they eat from your day.
