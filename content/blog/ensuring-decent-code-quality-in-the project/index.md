Code quality is the most important goal that you should pursue in your project.

## Unit tests

It does not matter, whether you choose xUnit, nUnit, or any other library. Strive for 100% coverage and enforce the minimum allowed code coverage by using a static code analyzer.

## Static Code Analysis

SonarLint, SonarQube.

## Code Reviews

Remote code reviews via Pull Requests. If possible also try to do the reviews in person.

## Automated CI/CD pipeline

Azure DevOps.

## Automated tests

Selenium.
