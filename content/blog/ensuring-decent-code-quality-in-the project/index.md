Code quality is the most important goal that you should pursue in your project. If neglected, it can cause a devastating effect in the long run.

## Unit tests

It does not matter, whether you choose xUnit, nUnit, or any other library. Strive for 100% coverage and enforce the minimum allowed code coverage by using a static code analyzer.

## Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is the way to ensure the code meets the certain quality bar.

What are the benefits of static code analysis?

First of all, it reduces the manual work for other developers during the code review.

## Code Reviews

Remote code reviews via Pull Requests. If possible also try to do the reviews in person.

## Automated CI/CD pipeline

Use CI/CD tools like Azure DevOps, TeamCity, Jenkins, or others.

## Automated tests

Selenium.
